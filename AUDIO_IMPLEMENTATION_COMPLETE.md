# üéôÔ∏è Audio Narrator Implementation - Complete

## What Was Implemented

Added full audio narration system using **Web Speech API** (browser built-in TTS) so you can hear audio immediately without needing API keys!

## Features Added

### 1. Audio Node Detection (`game.js:68-80`)
```javascript
let isAudioNode = false;  // Tracks if current player is the audio node
```

On session load, checks if current player is the designated audio node:
```javascript
const audioNodeId = currentSession.settings?.audioNodeId;
isAudioNode = audioNodeId === currentPlayerId;

if (isAudioNode) {
    console.log('üéôÔ∏è You are the audio node - you will hear narration');
}
```

### 2. Audio Narration System (`game.js:82-103`)

**playNarration() function:**
```javascript
function playNarration(text) {
    // Only play if this player is the audio node
    if (!isAudioNode) return;

    // Check if audio is enabled
    const audioNodeId = currentSession.settings?.audioNodeId;
    if (!audioNodeId) return;

    console.log('üéôÔ∏è Narrating:', text);

    // Use Web Speech API
    try {
        const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
        utterance.pitch = 0.8;  // Lower pitch for authority
        utterance.rate = 0.9;   // Slower for dramatic effect
        utterance.volume = 1.0;
        speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Audio playback failed:', error);
    }
}
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Only audio node player hears narration
- ‚úÖ Lower pitch (0.8) for authoritative voice
- ‚úÖ Slower rate (0.9) for dramatic effect
- ‚úÖ Full volume (1.0)
- ‚úÖ Error handling with fallback

### 3. Narration Trigger Points

**Night Phase Start (`game.js:172-179`):**
```javascript
async function startNightPhase() {
    // ...
    playNarration('Night falls. Everyone close your eyes.');
    await wait(2000);
    // ...
}
```

**Each Role Wake/Sleep (`game.js:196-219`):**
```javascript
async function executeSequentialNightPhase() {
    for (const role of nightRoles) {
        // Role wakes up
        playNarration(`${role.name}, wake up.`);
        await wait(1500);

        // ... role performs action ...

        // Role goes back to sleep
        playNarration(`${role.name}, close your eyes.`);
        await wait(1500);
    }
}
```

**Day Phase Start (`game.js:746-752`):**
```javascript
async function startDayPhase() {
    // ...
    playNarration('Everyone, wake up! The sun has risen. It is time to discuss.');
    await wait(2000);
    // ...
}
```

**Voting Phase Start (`game.js:890-896`):**
```javascript
async function startVoting() {
    // ...
    playNarration('Time to vote. Everyone, point to who you think is a werewolf.');
    await wait(2000);
    // ...
}
```

## Audio Narration Sequence

### Complete Game Flow with Audio:

1. **Night Phase Begins:**
   - üéôÔ∏è "Night falls. Everyone close your eyes."
   - ‚è±Ô∏è Wait 2 seconds

2. **Each Role (in order):**
   - üéôÔ∏è "Werewolf, wake up."
   - ‚è±Ô∏è Wait 1.5 seconds
   - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Player performs action
   - üéôÔ∏è "Werewolf, close your eyes."
   - ‚è±Ô∏è Wait 1.5 seconds
   - *(Repeat for each role)*

3. **Day Phase Begins:**
   - üéôÔ∏è "Everyone, wake up! The sun has risen. It is time to discuss."
   - ‚è±Ô∏è Wait 2 seconds

4. **Voting Phase:**
   - üéôÔ∏è "Time to vote. Everyone, point to who you think is a werewolf."
   - ‚è±Ô∏è Wait 2 seconds

## How It Works

### For the Host (when all other players are bots):

1. **Lobby:** Automatically selected as audio node (see `AUDIO_NODE_FIX.md`)
2. **Game Start:** Browser detects you're the audio node
3. **During Game:** You hear all narration through your device speakers
4. **Console:** Shows `üéôÔ∏è Narrating: [text]` messages

### For Other Players (if any):

- See text prompts only
- No audio plays on their device
- Silent gameplay experience

## Browser Compatibility

**Web Speech API** is supported in:
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (best quality)
- ‚úÖ Safari (good quality)
- ‚úÖ Firefox (good quality)
- ‚úÖ Opera

**Voices Available:**
- Uses system default TTS voice
- Quality varies by operating system:
  - **macOS:** High-quality Siri voices
  - **Windows:** Microsoft voices
  - **Android/iOS:** Google/Apple voices

## Testing the Audio

### 1. Create Game with Bots:
```
1. Open index.html
2. Create game (you become host)
3. Add 6-7 bots
4. Check audio node dropdown - should show you as selected
5. Start game
```

### 2. Check Console:
```javascript
// You should see:
üéôÔ∏è You are the audio node - you will hear narration
üéôÔ∏è Narrating: Night falls. Everyone close your eyes.
üéôÔ∏è Narrating: Werewolf, wake up.
// ... etc
```

### 3. Listen:
- Make sure your device volume is up
- You should hear narration at key moments
- Voice should be deeper and slower than normal

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't hear any audio"

**Check 1:** Are you the audio node?
- Look in console for: `üéôÔ∏è You are the audio node`
- Check lobby before starting - dropdown should show your name

**Check 2:** Is your device volume up?
- Check system volume
- Check browser isn't muted

**Check 3:** Does browser support Web Speech API?
```javascript
// Check in browser console:
if ('speechSynthesis' in window) {
    console.log('‚úÖ Web Speech API supported');
} else {
    console.log('‚ùå Web Speech API NOT supported');
}
```

**Check 4:** Are bots actually added?
- Need at least 1 bot to trigger auto-audio-node selection

### "Audio is too fast/slow/high-pitched"

Edit `playNarration()` parameters in `game.js:95-97`:
```javascript
utterance.pitch = 0.8;  // 0.0 (low) to 2.0 (high)
utterance.rate = 0.9;   // 0.1 (slow) to 10 (fast)
utterance.volume = 1.0; // 0.0 (silent) to 1.0 (max)
```

### "Console shows narration but no sound"

Browsers may block audio autoplay. Try:
1. Click anywhere on the page first
2. Refresh and start a new game
3. Check browser audio permissions

## Future Enhancements

### ElevenLabs Integration (High Quality Celebrity Voices)

Currently using Web Speech API. To upgrade to ElevenLabs (better quality, Trump voice, etc.):

1. **Get API Key:**
   - Sign up at https://elevenlabs.io (FREE tier: 10,000 chars/month)

2. **Create Backend:**
   - Implement Flask server from `AUDIO_NARRATOR_PLAN.md`
   - Add ElevenLabs API integration

3. **Update Frontend:**
   - Modify `playNarration()` to call backend
   - Add fallback to current Web Speech API
