## üöÄ Next Steps: Create GitHub Repository & Push

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub:** https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in repository details:**
   - **Repository name:** `werewolf-game` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Description:** "One Night Ultimate Werewolf - Multiplayer web game with bots, audio narrator, and Docker deployment"
   - **Visibility:** Public (required for free Render deployment)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

3. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd /Users/muhammadilahee/App/Werewolf

# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/werewolf-game.git

# Rename branch to main (if not already)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Example with username "muhammadilahee":**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/muhammadilahee/werewolf-game.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify

After pushing, go to your repository URL:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/werewolf-game
```

You should see all 44 files!

## üîê Authentication

When you run `git push`, GitHub will ask for authentication:

### Option A: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. **Generate a token:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Name: "Werewolf Game Deployment"
   - Expiration: 90 days (or "No expiration")
   - Scopes: Check `repo` (full control)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

2. **When prompted for password:**
   - Username: Your GitHub username
   - Password: Paste the token (NOT your GitHub password)

### Option B: SSH Key (More Secure)

If you prefer SSH:

1. **Generate SSH key:**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   # Press Enter 3 times (use default location, no passphrase)
   ```

2. **Copy public key:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   # Copy the entire output
   ```

3. **Add to GitHub:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Title: "Mac - Werewolf Project"
   - Paste the key
   - Click "Add SSH key"

4. **Use SSH remote URL:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/werewolf-game.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Remote already exists"
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/werewolf-game.git
```

### "Permission denied"
- Make sure you're using the correct username
- Use a personal access token instead of password
- Or set up SSH keys (see Option B above)

### "Branch name not main"
```bash
git branch -M main
```

### "Nothing to push"
- Your code is already on GitHub!
- Visit your repository URL to verify
