# 📝 Night Notes Feature

## Overview

Added a "Night Notes" section that displays during the Discussion phase to help players remember what they learned during the night. This is crucial for strategy as players need to recall information when discussing and voting.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. UI Section
Added a dedicated "Night Notes" section in the Discussion phase that shows:
- What role actions the player performed
- What information they learned
- Who they interacted with
- Any role changes that occurred

### 2. Data Storage
Each player now has a `nightNotes` array that stores strings describing their night actions:
- Initialized at the start of the night phase
- Populated by each role handler
- Displayed during discussion phase

### 3. Role-Specific Notes

Each role saves specific information:

#### 🐺 Werewolf
- **Solo:** "You are the only Werewolf."
- **With team:** "Other Werewolves: [names]"

#### 😈 Minion
- **No werewolves:** "No Werewolves found (all in center)."
- **With werewolves:** "Werewolves are: [names]"

#### 🔮 Seer
- **Viewed player:** "Viewed [name]: [role] [emoji]"
- **Viewed center:** "Viewed Center 1: [role] [emoji], Center 2: [role] [emoji]"
- **No selection:** "Did not view any cards."

#### 🔄 Robber
- **Swapped:** "Swapped with [name]. Now: [new role] [emoji]"
- **No swap:** "Did not swap with anyone."

#### 😴 Drunk
- **Swapped:** "Swapped with Center [number] (don't know new role)."
- **No swap:** "Did not swap with any center card."

#### 🧝 Insomniac
- **Not swapped:** "Still [role] [emoji] (not swapped)."
- **Was swapped:** "Card was swapped! Now: [new role] [emoji]"
