━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📡 ACCESS URLs:

🎯 TO TEST WITH 8 PLAYERS:

Since the game uses localStorage, here's how to simulate multiple players:

OPTION 1: Multiple Browser Windows (Recommended)
1. Open your main browser window → http://localhost:8000
2. Create a game and note the room code
3. Open 7 incognito/private windows
4. In each incognito window:
   - Go to http://localhost:8000
   - Join the game with the room code
   - Enter a different player name (Player1, Player2, etc.)

OPTION 2: Multiple Devices on Network
1. On your computer: http://localhost:8000 → Create game
2. On phones/tablets: http://10.0.0.59:8000 → Join game
3. Use the same room code on all devices

🤖 SIMULATING 8 PLAYERS:

Unfortunately, I can't directly control browser windows or simulate
clicking through the UI, but here's the manual process:

1. YOU (Main Window):
   - Create the game
   - You'll be "Host"

2. DUMMY PLAYERS (7 Incognito Windows):
   Window 1: Join as "Alice"
   Window 2: Join as "Bob"
   Window 3: Join as "Charlie"
   Window 4: Join as "Diana"
   Window 5: Join as "Eve"
   Window 6: Join as "Frank"
   Window 7: Join as "Grace"

3. START GAME:
   - In your main window (as host)
   - Configure roles if desired
   - Click "Start Game"

4. PLAY EACH ROLE:
   - Switch between windows to play each character
   - Follow the prompts for each role
   - During discussion, switch windows to "discuss"
   - Vote from each window

⚡ QUICK KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:

Mac:
  Cmd+Shift+N = New Incognito Window
  Cmd+Tab = Switch windows
  Cmd+W = Close window
